          scalable, secure web applications, I thrive on driving performance
          improvements. From creating seamless frontends to architecting robust
          backends, my expertise spans a range of technologies, including
          React.js, Node.js, and Spring Boot. My hands-on experience with cloud

          compliance with industry standards.
